# Repository of the course: "Python for Data Science Analytics"
## By FACE Prep

These repository would contain all the code files and other resources that have been used during different sessions of our courses.
These mentors are instructed to clone it and distribute the materials of each individual session after the commencement of every session.

All the mentors and students have to create a dedicated repository for this course and upload all the course related documents there for the purpose of evaluation.
It should include their code files, their commit logs, the notes that have been scribed during the class, the codes of the assignments and homeworks while maintaining proper folder structure
and standard naming formats as during the later part of the course; we'll be using Autogrades to evaluate the materials and award marks on the basis of our specified grading criteria.
Failing to maintain the aforementioned properly would result in failing the assignments.
